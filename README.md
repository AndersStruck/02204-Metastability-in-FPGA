# Metastability in FPGA
This project is made as the course project in 02204 Design of Asynchronous circuits Spring 2020 at the Danish Technical University.

The aim of the project is to detect metastability in FPGA's, and estimate parameters used to calculate MTBF.
The paramaters of interest is Delta and tau.
